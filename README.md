A Python-based tool for **automated detection, simulation, and visualization of logic hazards** in combinational digital circuits.  
The system models real-world gate delays, detects glitches during input transitions, and suggests Boolean fixes using consensus terms.

## 📌 Problem Overview

Even when a Boolean function is logically correct, **unequal propagation delays** in hardware can cause unwanted output glitches known as **hazards**.

Manual detection:
- Does not scale
- Misses timing-related failures
- Becomes unreliable for complex logic

This project provides a **timing-aware, automated solution**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- User-defined Boolean expression input
- Exhaustive truth table generation
- Randomized gate delay modeling
- Gate-level transition simulation
- Detection of:
  - Static-1 hazards
  - Static-0 hazards
  - Dynamic hazards
  - Essential hazards
- Monte Carlo–based confidence scoring
- Severity analysis using toggle counts
- Automatic consensus-term suggestions
- Optional waveform visualization
- Modular and extensible architecture

## 🧠 Hazard Types Explained

| Hazard Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Static-1** | Output briefly drops from 1 during transition |
| **Static-0** | Output briefly rises from 0 during transition |
| **Dynamic** | Output toggles multiple times before stabilizing |
| **Essential** | Hazard due to unavoidable delay dependencies |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Boolean Algebra
- Digital Logic Design
- Monte Carlo Simulation
- Matplotlib (waveform visualization)

## ▶️ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install matplotlib
````

### 2️⃣ Run the Analyzer

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 🧪 Example Input

```text
Enter Boolean expression (& | ~): (~A & ~B) | (A & ~C)
Variables (comma-separated): A, B, C
Show truth table? (y/n): y
Show waveform? (y/n): y
```

---

## 📊 Sample Output

```text
Hazard 1: Static-1 Hazard
Transition: (0, 0, 0) → (0, 0, 1)
Confidence: 35%
Severity (toggles): 2
Explanation: OR-reconvergent path delay mismatch.
Suggested Consensus Term: ~A & ~B
```

## 📈 Waveform Visualization

> Output glitches are visualized using step plots for precise timing analysis.

### Example Waveform

---

## 🧩 Hazard Fix Strategy

The analyzer suggests **consensus terms** to eliminate static hazards without changing logic functionality.

**Example**

```text
Original: A·B + A'·C
Fix:      A·B + A'·C + B·C
```

## 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out

* Models **real hardware timing**, not ideal logic
* Automates a traditionally manual verification task
* Bridges theory with practical digital design
* Suitable for:

  * ECE coursework
  * Hardware verification learning
  * Research foundations
  * Portfolio & interview discussion

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* SOP / POS canonical form support
* Karnaugh map visualization
* Gate-level netlist parsing
* Delay distribution tuning
* Exportable analysis reports
* HDL workflow integration
